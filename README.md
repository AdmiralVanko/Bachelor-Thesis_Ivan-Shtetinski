#How to run:

In any gase, make sure you have a folder named images in the same directory as the Asessment_Tool.py file)
-run the Asessment_Tool.py file
-upload a training file by clicking the upper-most button and selecting one of the 8 training files from the data folder
-afterwards upload a file, for which you would like to see the visualisations; after it is done a dashboard will open automatically
